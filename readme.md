#Wiki Web

Is a electron based app of which allows a user to create a connection web between two articles.

## How it works
First input is the start page. It will go to the wikipedia page with that title and gather every link on that page, then it will go to every link and get all links on those pages. It does this until it finds one link to the target page, then it will not add anymore search terms, and will finish all of it's current queue, to see if there are multiple links to the desired page.

## Setup
You will need to install npm
Then open a command prompt in the director and execute ```npm run start```  
**Note:** All data your computer loads will be store ```'./data/'``` folder, to allow for faster searches the more a user users it.
